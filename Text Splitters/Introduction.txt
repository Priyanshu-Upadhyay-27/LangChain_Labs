Text Splitting is the process of breaking large chunks of text into smaller, manageable pieces(chunks) which an LLM can
handle effectively. It is performed using text splitters.

Why it is significant:
It overcomes models limitations as sometimes the input text can exceed the model input size limit.
It helps in embedding, summarization and Semantic Search.
It helps in optimizing computer resources because working with smaller chunks of data can be more efficient and parallel
processing can be done easily.
