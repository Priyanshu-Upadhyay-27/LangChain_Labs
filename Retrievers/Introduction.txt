A retriever is a component in langchain which fetches relevant documents from a data source in response to a user query.
It's like a search engine and search required documents in the database.
All retrievers are runnables.
Types Of Retrievers:
1. Based On Data Sources:
    - Wikipedia Retriever
    - Vector Store Retriever
    - Arxiv Retriever
2. Based On Searching Techniques:
    -MMR
    -Multi query

Why to use a vector retriever if we have methods like .similarity_search() in vector stores?
It's because, it increases abstraction(i.e. complexity will be less), if we are making a scalable and working project,
methods used there, expects a retriever object and not a raw vector store, which ultimately makes the workflow seamless.
With Retrievers, you can not only retrieve the relevant documents but can write custom code for filtering, reranking,
embedding transformation etc.
