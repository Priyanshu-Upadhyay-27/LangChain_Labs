Document Loaders are used to load documents by converting them into a common  Langchain document object(standardized format),
which are coming from a different source like .pdf, .docx, etc.

Document object:
Document(
    page_content ="The Actual content of the document",
    meta_data = {"Source":"filename.pdf",........}
)
